### You **must understand GStreamer** because:

- DeepStream **is GStreamer**
    
- Isaac ROS internally uses similar graph ideas
    
- All NVIDIA pipelines rely on it
    

### Use cases:

- **Visualization only** → GStreamer
    
- **YOLO inference on video** → DeepStream
    
- **Full robotics stack** → Isaac ROS
    

Your current goal:

> GPU rendering from R2B dataset

👉 **GStreamer is the correct tool**
